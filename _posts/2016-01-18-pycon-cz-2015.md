In November, we've been to [PyCon CZ 2015](https://cz.pycon.org/2015/). And when I say *we* I mean Fedora Python maint and friends team: Matěj Stuchlík, Robert Kuska, Slávek Kabrda, Michal Cyprian, Michal Srb and me.

PyCon CZ 2015 was the first PyCon in the Czech Republic. With Fedora being very Python friendly and with our Python 3 as default feature, we thought we had to be there to present Fedora. We actually done that in 2 ways:

Saturday: Booth
---------------

We had a standard blue Fedora booth with stickers, DVDs, 3D printer and (which is quite an experiment) blue soft drinks.

The blue drinks were quite an attraction, but we had to much and we were scared if people will drink them all, so we stepped up and start delivering the drinks to sessions, which helped a lot, we almost run out on Saturday and only a few bottles had left for Sunday workshop sessions. See the cases behind Slávek, our Python 3 terrorist:

If you observe the photo carefully, you might find some new Fedora Loves Python stickers we've designed especially for the event (but we have plenty more for next events as well).

Sunday: Python 3 porting sprint
-------------------------------

On Sunday, the venue has changed and there was no room for booth, so we'd changed our tactics and organized a sprint instead.
[Python 3 Porting FAD](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD_Python_3_Porting_2015) was an international Fedora Activity Day focused on porting stuff to Python 3; on PyCon we were there to do our part and to help others join us. While the FAD itself was a huge success, I must admit that not many attendants of PyCon were interested in our sprint and visited rather some workshops happening in the same time slot.
